    AI Analysis Summary

You've demonstrated good use of semantic elements like <main> and <footer>, and included important metadata in the <head>. To take it further, consider correcting attribute names like classname to class, grouping footer links in a list for better structure, and ensuring your main content has clear headings and meaningful content for better document flow.
Priority recommendations:

    1

    Replace custom elements like <app-root>, <app-main-layout>, and <app-footer> with or wrap them in native semantic elements to improve clarity and compatibility.
    2

    Group related footer links inside a <nav> or <ul> to clearly define navigation structure.
    3

    Add meaningful headings and content inside the <main> element to establish a clear information hierarchy.
    4

    Correct classname attributes to class on all elements to ensure proper styling and maintainability.
    5

    Use rel="noopener noreferrer" on all links with target="_blank" to improve security and privacy.

Footer links are not grouped in a list. Grouping related links in a list (<ul> or <nav>) improves semantic clarity and helps users and search engines understand navigation structure. This causes less clear content relationships and harder navigation.
